## Technology

This project uses a host of modern technologies. The core ones are:

- ECMAScript 6: Also known as ES2015, this is the newest version of Javascript with next-generation features like arrow functions, generators, enhanced object literals, 
spread operators and more. See [this link](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/ECMAScript) for details.

- [NodeJS](https://nodejs.org): NodeJS is a server-side JavaScript runtime engine built 
on Chrome's V8 JavaScript engine. It is lightweight, efficient and greatly used in building web apps. Please visit [this link](https://nodejs.org) for more details.

- [React](https://facebook.github.io/react/) and [ReactDOM](https://facebook.github.io/react/docs/react-dom.html): 
These were developed by Facebook and are used for building web pages that are structured as a collection of components. These components are kept as independent as possible. See [this link](https://facebook.github.io/react/).

- [The Flux architecture](https://facebook.github.io/flux/): This is a design architecture for building stable web apps with, among other things, a unidirectional flow of data. See [this link](https://facebook.github.io/flux/) 
for details.

That's easy. In the root of the project. create a file named `.env` and add the following line to it:

``` bash
PORT=<your_desired_port>
```

where <your\_desired\_port> is the port you want to use. So, if you want to use port `8080`, you will write:

``` bash 
PORT=8080
```
